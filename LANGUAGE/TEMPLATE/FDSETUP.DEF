FreeDOS 1.2+ Installer Language Template File for all installation messages
handled by the FDSETUP.BAT and default handling of the FDCHECK, FDERROR,
FDICLS, FDICTRLC, FDIFAIL, FDNOTICE, FDSPLASH and FDTHANK utility batch files.

Create a subdirectory under the LANGUAGE directory using the DOS %LANG% language
ID and place your language translation of this file there.

These "Language" translation files also include settings for text frame
dimensions and other settings that can change based on the language text.
Some settings (like frame style) are handled inside the batch script. While
some other settings like color and text may be passed through %1-%9 parameters
so the text can be properly formatted. Think of them as additional command-line
parameters to their counterparts that are in the batch script file.

Also, the ID strings must exactly match those provided. Do not indent, change
the letter case or add any spaces prior to the "=" for the ID keys. Doing so
will cause a match not to be found and generate "Parameter Error" messages
in the installer. All text that does not match a requested ID string is ignored.
So, basically, you can use any character like ;#!* or none at all to denote
commment text. I'm going to use the ; just for readablility
