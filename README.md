# The FreeDOS Installer (FDI)

The [FreeDOS](http://freedos.org) Installer is a customizable and flexible batch
based installation kit based on [V8Power Tools](http://up.lod.bz/V8Power) batch
file enhancement utilities.

### Installation Requirements

FDI has a fairly modest set of requirements.

* EGA or better graphics.
* 80386 or better CPU.
* 640k RAM (under 4Mb is untested)

(Although V8Power Tools only requires an 8086, some other utilities required
by FDI at present do not support CPUs lower than a 386)
